# Game On: The Rivalry Between Men’s and Women’s Tennis

### Mathematical Data Science Major Cumulative Final Project

This project is motivated by gender disparities, namely the treatment and discourse of male versus female athletes in tennis’ most prestigious international tournaments. After mining match-level data from the Sportradar Tennis API and historical rankings, I investigated the entertainment value of tennis matches by gender through an exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing. Findings suggested that men’s tennis showcases greater competitiveness with players having similar match-level statistics, particularly excelling in service games, while women’s tennis leans towards risk-taking, producing more winners and longer games with more unforced errors. Thus, the data shows that neither gender’s matches are statistically more entertaining, as they offer different dynamics and value to viewers.
